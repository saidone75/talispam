# talispam
a talispam (or spamulet) is a program held to act as a charm to avert spam and bring good messages

## Very quick roundtrip
### Build
get the sources:
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/saidone75/talispam.git -b v0.3.0
```
produce an uberjar with leiningen:
```console
$ cd talispam
$ lein uberjar
Compiling talispam.config
Compiling talispam.core
[...]
Compiling talispam.whitelist
Created /home/saidone/talispam/target/uberjar/talispam-0.3.0.jar
Created /home/saidone/talispam/target/uberjar/talispam-0.3.0-standalone.jar
```
create a native binary (need a GraalVM toolchain installed and configured):
```console
$ lein native
Build on Server(pid: 20771, port: 40355)
[./target/talispam:20771]    classlist:   4,185.77 ms,  2.15 GB
[...]
[./target/talispam:20771]      [total]: 244,502.81 ms,  1.98 GB
```
and copy the executable binary (target/talispam) somewhere in your path
### Configuration
clone the sample configuration from [talispam-config](https://github.com/saidone75/talispam-config) on your ~/.talispam folder:
```console
$ cd ~
$ git clone https://github.com/saidone75/talispam-config.git -b v0.3.0 .talispam
```
(WARNING: contains a quite big spam/ham training corpus, you may want to train the filter against your own collections)

train bayesian classifier:
```console
$ talispam learn
talispam 0.3.0
building classifier db âœ“
done!
```
### Test
print spam/ham score (lower score is ham, higher is spam)
```console
$ cat .talispam/easy_ham/02051.58e196144807bd76d7b77d4b7efb6d32 | talispam score
14
$ cat .talispam/spam/00460.8996dc28ab56dd7b6f35b956deceaf22 | talispam score
98
```
### Compatibility
I imagined it as a drop-in replacement for SpamAssassin on my personal mail server: invoked without arguments will add the same spam identification header and return the message to stdout:
```console
$ cat .talispam/spam/00460.8996dc28ab56dd7b6f35b956deceaf22 | talispam | head -n 5

X-Spam-Checker-Version: talispam 0.3.0 on kugelmass
X-Spam-Flag: YES

```
integration with procmail is pretty much the same as well, just add these lines on your .procmailrc:
```

### Performance
on my little mail server (Intel Atom D2550 @ 1.86GHz) is extraordinarily fast, expecially in comparison with SpamAssassin (to be honest, not directly comparable because SpamAssassin perform a lot more checks):
```console
$ time cat .talispam/spam/00460.8996dc28ab56dd7b6f35b956deceaf22 | spamassassin | head -n 5
